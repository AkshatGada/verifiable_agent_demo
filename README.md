# Verifiable AI Agent Framework : Version 0 

# Why We Built This Framework

As AI agents become integral parts of decentralized applications, ensuring their actions and data inputs are transparent, tamperâ€‘proof, and auditable is critical. This framework provides a stepâ€‘byâ€‘step pipeline that:

1. **Identifies** AI agents with cryptographically verifiable DIDs.
2. **Anchors** agent identities and reputation on a blockchain-based registry.
3. **Validates** and commits input data (e.g., GitHub README files) via offâ€‘chain hashing, verifiable credentials, and onâ€‘chain anchoring.

By integrating these components, we create a bulletâ€‘proof provenance trailâ€”from raw data ingestion through signed credentials to immutable blockchain records.

## The Critical Need for Verifiable AI

The rapid proliferation of AI agents across industries has created an urgent need for trustworthy systems that can be verified without relying on blind trust. As AI agents increasingly handle sensitive tasks autonomously, several critical challenges emerge:

### Trust Without Transparency Isn't Trust

Today's AI systems operate as black boxes, making decisions with little visibility into their data sources, reasoning processes, or execution pathways. This lack of transparency creates significant risks:

- **Data integrity cannot be guaranteed** without verifiable proof of what information an AI agent consumed
- **Accountability becomes impossible** when there's no cryptographic trail of an agent's actions
- **Attribution is challenging** without verifiable agent identities tied to responsible entities

### Preventing Sophisticated Attacks

Our framework directly addresses several critical vulnerabilities that plague current AI agent deployments:

1. **Knowledge Base Poisoning**: By cryptographically verifying input data through deterministic hashing and on-chain anchoring, we prevent attackers from manipulating the sources that inform agent decisions

2. **Memory and Context Manipulation**: Our execution logging and Merkle-tree commitment approach creates tamper-evident records that prevent attackers from exploiting agent memory mechanisms

3. **Orchestration Exploitation**: By establishing verifiable identities through DIDs and anchoring them on-chain, we prevent confused deputy attacks where malicious actors trick trusted agents into performing harmful tasks

4. **Impact Chain Vulnerabilities**: Our system isolation approach with cryptographic boundaries helps contain potential breaches and prevent cascading failures across interconnected systems

## Verifiability as the Foundation of Trusted AI

Verifiability serves as the missing piece in the AI ecosystem, enabling agents to operate with unprecedented levels of trust:

- **Transparent Decision Trails**: Our framework enables users to backtrace exactly how an AI agent arrived at its conclusions, creating accountability for every action

- **Provable Authenticity**: Through cryptographic proofs, we demonstrate that agent actions are genuinely autonomous and not manipulated by hidden human operatorsâ€”essential for establishing trusted agentic systems

- **Immutable Reputation**: By anchoring agent identities and attestations on-chain, we create an indelible record of agent behavior that builds cumulative trust over time

- **Cross-System Trust**: Our verifiable credentials approach allows AI agents to interact across organizational boundaries with cryptographically verifiable trust, eliminating silos

As AI agents increasingly operate in high-stakes environments, this framework provides the essential verification layer that transforms AI from a black box into a transparent, auditable system worthy of trust. By establishing unbroken chains of verifiable evidence from raw inputs to final outputs, we're building the foundation for a new generation of AI systems that can be trusted to operate autonomously without sacrificing transparency, security, or accountability.

# ðŸŽ¯ What We've Achieved (Start to Finish)

1. **GitHub Agent Initialization**
   - Built a custom AI agent on the Sentient Agent Framework that fetches and summarizes README files from arbitrary GitHub repositories.

2. **Cryptographic Agent Identity**
   - Generated a did:key:â€¦ DID for the agent and securely stored its JWK keypair.

3. **Foundational Onâ€‘Chain Attestation**
   - Anchored the agent's DID onâ€‘chain via a claim in the IdentityRegistry smart contract, binding agent identity to your Ethereum address.

4. **Deterministic Inputâ€‘Root Computation**
   - Fetched each README, SHAâ€‘256â€‘hashed its contents, sorted the hashes, and produced a single inputRoot digest.

5. **Inputâ€‘Root Verifiable Credential**
   - Wrapped the inputRoot in a W3Câ€‘compliant Verifiable Credential and signed it with the agent's DID using DIDKit.

6. **Inputâ€‘Root Onâ€‘Chain Anchoring**
   - Published the same inputRoot hash under keccak256(agentDID) in the IdentityRegistry contract for immutable public proof.

7. **Executionâ€‘Level Logging**
   - Instrumented every agent stepâ€”prompts, tool calls, LLM inputs/outputsâ€”with timestamped, hashed log entries.

8. **Merkleâ€‘Tree Construction**
   - Built a Merkle tree over all executionâ€‘log hashes to compute a single executionRoot that commits to the entire session.

9. **Decentralized Trace Storage**
   - Published the full execution trace and Merkleâ€‘tree data to IPFS, yielding immutable CIDs for auditor retrieval.

10. **Executionâ€‘Root Verifiable Credential**
    - Packaged the executionRoot in a W3Câ€‘Verifiable Credential and signed it with the agent's DID.

11. **Executionâ€‘Root Onâ€‘Chain Anchoring**
    - Recorded the executionRoot hash onâ€‘chain in the IdentityRegistry, extending your proof ledger to cover runtime behavior.

12. **Zeroâ€‘Knowledge Verification**
    - Generated a zkâ€‘SNARK proof that the Merkle tree was constructed correctly, and deployed a Solidity verifier to confirm the proof both offâ€‘chain and onâ€‘chain.

## 1. GitHub Agent

The **GitHub Agent** is built on top of the Sentient Agent Framework and performs the following tasks:

1. **Fetch**: Uses the GitHub API to retrieve the raw README.md from one or more repository URLs.
2. **Vectorize** (optional extension): Builds a vector store from README content for retrievalâ€‘augmented summarization.
3. **Summarize**: Produces a concise summary of each repository.

### Setup & Usage

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/verifiable_agent_demo.git
cd verifiable_agent_demo

# 2. Create & activate venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the agent server
python app.py

# 5. Query the agent
curl -N http://localhost:8000/assist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session":{â€¦},"query":{"id":"","prompt":"https://github.com/user/repo"}}'
```

Logs will show each README fetched and the generated summary.

## 2. Identity Registry

The **Identity Registry** is a smart contract that maintains a mapping from `keccak256(agentDID)` to a list of claims (topics and data).

### Contract: `IdentityRegistry.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract IdentityRegistry {
    struct Claim { bytes32 topic; bytes data; uint256 timestamp; }
    mapping(bytes32 => Claim[]) public claims;

    function claim(bytes32 id, bytes32 topic, bytes calldata data) external {
        claims[id].push(Claim(topic, data, block.timestamp));
    }
}
```

### Deployment

1. **Install Hardhat**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers dotenv
   npx hardhat  # select "Create an empty hardhat.config.js"
   ```
2. **Configure** your `hardhat.config.js` with your RPC and private key in `.env`.
3. **Compile & Deploy**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_registry.js --network 
   ```
4. **Save** the deployed address to `.env â†’ REGISTRY_ADDR`.

## 3. Input Validation & Commitment

This module creates an **inputRoot** from your agent's raw inputs, issues a Verifiable Credential, and anchors the root onâ€‘chain.

### A. Compute the Inputâ€‘Root

```bash
# Generate the unsigned credential payload
python scripts/make_input_root_cred.py \
  https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum \
  https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain \
> proofs/cred.json
```

This script:
- Fetches each README
- SHAâ€‘256 hashes each text
- Sorts the digests and hashes the concatenation into `inputRoot`
- Outputs a pure JSON VC payload to `proofs/cred.json`

### B. Issue the Verifiable Credential

Using DIDKit (Dockerized):

```bash
# Remove any stale proofs
rm -f proofs/inputRoot-*.json

# Issue & sign the VC
docker run --rm -i \
  -v "$(pwd)":/data -w /data \
  ghcr.io/spruceid/didkit-cli:latest \
  credential issue --key-path .agent_key.jwk \
   proofs/inputRoot-.json
```

Verify the credential:
```bash
didkit credential verify proofs/inputRoot-.json
# Should report {"checks":["proof"],"warnings":[],"errors":[]}
```

### C. Anchor Onâ€‘Chain

```bash
python scripts/publish_input_root_tx.py
```

This script:
- Reads the `` from the filename
- Builds a transaction calling `registry.claim( keccak256(agentDID), keccak256("inputRoot"), bytes(root) )`
- Signs & sends it with `OWNER_KEY`
- Prints the transaction hash

Verify onâ€‘chain:
```bash
python scripts/verify_onchain.py
# Confirms topic == keccak256("inputRoot") and data == root
```

---

## What's Next

- **Execution Tracing**: Record and Merkleâ€‘tree hash the agent's runtime logs, then verify with zkâ€‘proofs.
- **Reputation Signals**: Build social and behavioral attestations on top of this identity foundation.

> By following these steps, you have a fully decentralized, transparent, and verifiable pipeline for your AI agentâ€”from data ingestion to onâ€‘chain proof.
